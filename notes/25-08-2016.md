* [jared] good ideas that we could implement:
	* pervasive themes
		* ability to theme newtab, home, reader, preferences pages
			* phase 1 could be simple as newtab and home, phase 2 could be preferences, extensions, reader, etc
		* colors appear throughout the browser
	* deep integration with the rest of the browser
		* ability to create a theme directly in the browser
			* [stretch goal] right-click -> "set as firefox background"
				* [stretch goal 2] we could get dominant colors from the image, then generate some palettes based on that color and users could pick a palette from those options or tweak/create their own
			* color pickers in about:customizing
		* [stretch goal] potentially save & share directly to AMO (could increase Firefox Accounts adoption)
	* accessibility minded users
		* include some accessibility features like contrast adjustment and font-size adjustments
* [mike] took a look at some add-ons and browsers
	* not a bunch of similarities between browsers
	* liked from Opera: ability to theme about:newtab and about:home, "it's a huge amount of real estate that people keep seeing"
		* nice to make it more customizable
	* saw the Theme Font and Size add-on, allows users to change fonts and font-sizes used to render the browser and background colors too
		* we could support webfonts but not sure how well that would work or look <-- UX team input needed
			* Ship with whitelisted fonts that are known to work
	* TODO: review survey questions one last time
* [both] merge about:addons and about:preferences into one page to 'Appearance' be about customizing Firefox, not add-ons.
	* https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/2f743t/mozilla_should_merge_the_preferences_and_addons/
	* TODO: file bug :-)
* Follow-up from last week's todos:
	* Theme ideas from talking with Dolske
		* pick up theme colors from the OS
		* pick a primary color and then use algorithms to offer nice looking color palettes
			* Definitely practically feasible
		* change "set as desktop background" to "set as firefox background"
	* Theme abilities from other browsers:
		* Opera:
			* background image for newtab, about:extensions, about:settings
				* background image can also be an html5 video
		* Chrome:
			* background-image for newtab
			* background-image for navbar + selected tab
			* background-color for background-tab, hovering background tab shows translucent selected tab image
			* background-image for tabs toolbar
			* background-colors and foreground text colors for the new tab page
		* Edge:
			* no customization of themes, comes with only a light and dark theme. though these themes are pervasive and change the color palette of all menus (app menu, context menu) as well as the toolbars and notification bars. no effect on the new tab page
		* Vivaldi Browser:
			* create themes right in the browser, can select colors, enable/disable accent color from active page, enable/disable accent color on window, enable/disable transparent tabs, adjust the border-radius ("corner rounding")
			* themes are pervasive like the ones found in Edge
			* can change tabs to be on top, right, bottom, or left side
			* set background-color and background-image for new tab page
			* can enable contrast adjustment to re-balance color palette
				* very nice accessibility feature
		* Brave Browser:
			* no theme ability found
	* Theme abilities from popular Firefox add-ons
		* Classic Theme Restorer
			* change shape of tabs
			* small buttons
		* Colorful Tabs
			* Tabs have unique colors per domain
		* Quicksaver made a few extraordinary ones
			* 'Beyond Australis'
			* 'OmniSidebar'
		* Theme Font & Size Changer
			* https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/theme-font-size-changer/?src=cb-dl-users
		* LavaFox V2 still alive
			* https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/lavafox-v1/
		* Also Hemperor, FT Deep Dark
	* Popular userstyles from userstyles.org
		* only saw one in the most popular list
			* https://userstyles.org/styles/123988/firefox-black, this sets the background image of about:home and the toolbar backgrounds
	* Theme abilities from popular desktop and mobile software (non-browsers)
		* Red line: apps that are often visible to the user, benefit from theme-ability
		* Textra SMS
			* Screen color: light, light & night mode, dark, black
			* Theme colors: primary and accent
			* Bubble colors: received and sent along with text color for each
			* App Icon color
		* WinAmp + Windows Media Player
			* Ability to full customize the full look and feel of the browser
