Firefox Themes
  * Sep 21, 2016
    * Status updates
      * Met with UX last week and this week to go over the project and describe what our current thoughts are
        * Will schedule another meeting with UX next week to continue discussions
      * Have a meeting with Product Managers later today to discuss getting their help and direction around the project
      * Got some help from K-9 in answering some of the questions from last week
        * webextensions uses xpcshell and mochitest for test automation
        * if we take the webextension route
          * allow js to run and implement the API through JS
            * current thinking is that themes would not be allowed to have other webextension permissions. we would only allow them to have the "theme" permission exclusively
          * otherwise, users write a manifest file in yaml/json/etc and then that will declare the whole theme
            * themes that want to adapt to environmental changes (time of day/number of tabs/etc) would require js to run and would be written as a webextension which loads the manifest, potentially
    * Action items:
      * [jaws] need to see what it would be like to introduce and use a new permission within WebExtensions
      * [jaws] need to see how setting background images on the in-content pages would work
      * need to see how setting background and text colors on the menus and panels would work  
        * or: any overriding CSS styles
      * [mikedeboer] find a place within WebExtensions API (namespace, if you will)
      * mikedeboer;tent] need to find hard nuts in developer edition theme that we'll encounter
      * need to see how we can supply custom SVG parts (ex. tab curve and back-button shape)
        * we could use the bezier editor from devtools to allow people to draw the shape of a tab end
          * we could then mirror that tab end to create the tab for both pinned and regular tabs
            * we could allow the user to edit one side of the tab but show the tab with both sides so they can see how it would look
          * it doesn't have to be symmetrical, we could allow asymmetrical tab designs, not sure how high demand would be for that though and it would be more complicated to implement
      * need to find a place for an editor to live
      * documentation & testing setup  
      * testing scope: include/ exclude marionette, talos, etc
        * [from K-9] xpcshell and mochitests for WebExtensions
        * hooking in to mozscreenshots
      * must define final scope for MVP (v1 feature list)  
        * how many developers do we we need (current thinking is 2 people from firefox-desktop team and 1 person from webextensions team)  
          * smaller core team is probably better for v1
          * how many developer-years?
