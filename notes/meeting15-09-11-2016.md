  * Icons:
    * Will probably switch icon patch to only allow SVG icons due to the four sizes needed for icons (lo-dpi toolbar and menu, hi-dpi toolbar and menu)
    * Jared will attach an updated patch today
  * Extreme demo:
    * Working on creating a packaged extension that will be easy for others to install and try out
    * Mike will attach a reviewable patch today
  * Chrome theme demo
    * Mike will make sure that themes from the Chrome webstore will load into cedar Fx
      * Try with a random sample
      * Use http://crxextractor.com/ to download any extension from the store
        * Use `unzip` to extract it, OSX GUI tools fail due to extra bytes at the start of file
  * Mike will look at Win & Lin failures/ oranges
  * WRT the in-browser editor demo: https://www.themebeta.com/chrome-theme-creator-online.html (inspiration?)
    * There may be more already

(Jaws meeting with dolske)
  * should gather memory and window creation costs of SVG icons
    * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=650968 was for lwtheme's being slow
    * what kind of criteria can we put together for this
      * there may be a couple that are kinda gimmies: new opening window speed, TART, etc
      * compare it with the data that we got when we looked at using SVG icons for the browser by default
  * want to minimize potential footguns
  * should AMO inspect SVGs for expensive features that will hurt performance
  * svg icons may help because we might be able to work with them in high contrast mode also
  * if we want to scale the chrome, then svg icons could help there
  * we could optimize the svg files on install of the theme or create cached copies of the rasterized icon, keeping the SVG around for future compatibility
  * be able to have a recommendation as to what we should do
    * pros and cons
