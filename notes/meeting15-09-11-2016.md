  * Icons:
    * Will probably switch icon patch to only allow SVG icons due to the four sizes needed for icons (lo-dpi toolbar and menu, hi-dpi toolbar and menu)
    * Jared will attach an updated patch today
  * Extreme demo:
    * Working on creating a packaged extension that will be easy for others to install and try out
    * Mike will attach a reviewable patch today
  * Chrome theme demo
    * Mike will make sure that themes from the Chrome webstore will load into cedar Fx
      * Try with a random sample
      * Use http://crxextractor.com/ to download any extension from the store
        * Use `unzip` to extract it, OSX GUI tools fail due to extra bytes at the start of file
  * Mike will look at Win & Lin failures/ oranges
  * WRT the in-browser editor demo: https://www.themebeta.com/chrome-theme-creator-online.html (inspiration?)
    * There may be more already
