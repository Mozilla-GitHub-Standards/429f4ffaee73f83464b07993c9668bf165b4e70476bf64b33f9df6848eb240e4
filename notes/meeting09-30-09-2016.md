* 30 Sep, 2016 (Meeting with UX)
  * Stephen and Philipp didn't meet to talk about things in the past week due to Stephen being sick
  * Philipp is concerned about maintainability as we allow more things to get edited it might be harder to fix going forward
  * Philipp does thing customizing things like the background image of the homepage is a big win because it is easy to do without affecting much
  * Stephen thinks about this like
    * progressive enhancement
    * LWT starting point
      * 'we' take care of making all the other things look nice
      * svg icons will allow us to change the color of them to match the theme (not here yet but hopefully soon!)
    * Add more customizable properties per Fx release
      * like WebExtensions APIs - more get added every time
    * SVG icons would help _a lot_
    * avoiding layout / size changes
  * Mike mentioned the demos idea
    * Previous meeting notes list them: https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-themes/blob/master/notes/meeting08-28-09-2016.md
  * Philipp noted that he'd like to get to a concrete list of configurable properties
