* 19 Oct, 2016
  * [jaws] wasn't able to spend much time on theme related stuff
  * [mikedeboer] landed the lightweight theme support, now also submitted a pull request for devedition theme mapping
    * adding more gradients, properties, stuff like that
      * working on having it apply more properly
      * will attach a work-in-progress patch to the bug
        * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1311352
          * depends on work being done by bgrinstead to use css variables instead of defines for tabcurve width and half-width
            * bgrins' bug: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1122726
            * blocked by potential talos regressions
        * [jaws] will help investigate why the background colors aren't applying to the toolbars
  * [mikedeboer] created a google doc for mapping between the chrome manifest property names and groups to the firefox theme/css variables that we use throughout
    * https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YScpOVL5WdNDhQY2Nngh4YkK0bOpkfwJvpRjpMSxMWo/edit#gid=0
  * coming back to our priority order and where we stand on that:
    * [1] background on about:home
      * landed and working
    * [2] dynamic themes through webextension APIs
      * swapped order with part 3 because it depends on more static theming APIs being defined
    * [3] dark theme support
      * most of the google styles have landed and apply to the new tab page / (homepage?)
      * devedition theme mapping is in progress, being tracked in bug 1311352 (depends on bug 1122726)
    * [4] in-browser theme editing
      * not started yet, but jgruen has been playing around with the idea
    * [5] demo square tabs
      * being implemented by part 3 (dark theme support)
  * new priority order of implementation based on above status:
    * [1] background on about:home
      * landed, will want to put these styles on about:newtab as well as support for of the properties. need to file a bug for this follow-up work
    * [2] dark theme support / square tabs
      * in progress, tracked by bug 1311352
    * [3] dynamic themes through webextension APIs
      * lacking a clear starting point for this work
      * add a background.js script to the webextension manifest
      * then in ext-theme.js in registerSchemaAPI we define the functions as part of the object that gets returned
        * anything added to registerSchemaAPI will need a corresponding description in the schema
    * [4] in-browser theme editing
  * tasks for next week
    * [k-9] create an initial patch for dynamic themes
    * [jaws] help mikedeboer investigate why the colors aren't being applied to the toolbars
    * [mikedeboer] developer edition/ dark theme support & finish up Chrome API support demo
      * TODO: show off porting an actual chrome theme over
