    * Goals
      * Provide stable API for theming that doesn't break with updates by »upgrading« LWTs to support more customizations
      * Something that users will enjoy
      * Replace old theming APIs?
    * Non-Goals
      * Provide complete replacement for XUL themes
      * Completely implement add-ons like classic theme restorer
    * What it looks like as an implementation is undefined so far
    * Open questions
      * How much / how little do we want to add to the capabilities of LWT?
        * Ideas: https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-themes/blob/master/notes/meeting04-14-09-2016.md
      * How does one create one of those new »upgraded« LWTs?
    * Timeframe
      * Start implementation in Q4
      * Bare bones V1 API ready to ship by end of Q4
      * Having prototypes to talk about in Hawaii would be nice
      * Actual release: Q1?
