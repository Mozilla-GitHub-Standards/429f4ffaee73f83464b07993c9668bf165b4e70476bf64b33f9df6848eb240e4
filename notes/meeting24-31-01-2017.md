* nice work with the quick review cycles on the lwt themes, dynamic updates, and chrome parity
* getting slow review turn around on the addon work, stuck on a point of contention about moving the theme work to toolkit versus keeping it in browser
* looking like the addon work won't be that complicated, took some time to track down codepaths
* [mikedeboer] is investigating enabling and disabling lwthemes, shouldn't be too massive
* [mattw] reading of theme properties in JS
