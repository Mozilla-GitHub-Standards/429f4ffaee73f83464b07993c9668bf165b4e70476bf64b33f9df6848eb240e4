Firefox Themes

* Sep 14, 2016
	* next steps:
		* [mikedeboer] send survey conclusion to the lists, containing this information in proze (more or less)
			* will send out to Justin & Jared first.
		* prototype what the api might look like (assign them as we start working on them)
			* [jaws] need to see what it would be like to introduce and use a new permission within WebExtensions
			* [jaws] need to see how setting background images on the in-content pages would work
			* need to see how setting background and text colors on the menus and panels would work
				* or: any overriding CSS styles
			* [mikedeboer] find a place within WebExtensions API (namespace, if you will)
			* [mikedeboer;tent] need to find hard nuts in developer edition theme that we'll encounter
			* need to see how we can supply custom SVG parts (ex. tab curve and back-button shape)
			* need to find a place for the editor to live
			* documentation & testing setup
				* testing scope: include/ exclude marionette, talos, etc
				* [from K-9] xpcshell and mochitests for WebExtensions
				* hooking in to mozscreenshots
			* must define final scope for MVP (v1 feature list)
				* how many developers do we we need (current thinking is 2 people)
					* smaller core team is probably better for v1
					* how many developer-years?
	* [jaws] ideas for new theme api
		* should have all the abilities of lightweight theme api
			* includes tabs toolbar, navigation toolbar, and bookmarks toolbar
		* [from mkaply]
			* allow multiple backgrounds and all of the CSS properties of the `background` shorthand
			* allow for disabling the text shadow or overriding with a specific color
			* remove footerURL
		* [from ntim]
			* allow the following CSS properties as well:
				* color
				* box-shadow
				* text-shadow
				* filter (not for v1)
				* border/outline (could range bound the width to prevent firefox breakage)
				* font (could range bound the size to prevent firefox breakage)
				* text-decoration/text-align/text-tranform
				* -webkit-text-fill-color
		* set background images for about:newtab, about:preferences, about:addons, and about:customizing
			* it is important to allow the toolbar background images to show up in about:customizing as it affects how the final browser will look when exiting customize mode
			* some background images should be called out specifically and have names that will determine their positioning such as: theme_newtab_attribution
		* menus / doorhangers / panels:
			* background and text color
		* use the WebExtensions API and introduce a new permission for themes:
			* If we use the Web Extensions API, then we don't need to introduce special ways for themes to update themselves based on external factors such as time of day, number of tabs, etc.
				* Themes that want to adjust based on external factors can just request extra permissions to run JS and then use that JS to adjust the theme
			* [from K-9] WebExtensions make it easy to support permissions and sub-permissions.  We could add a new "themes" permission and require sub-permissions to access more advanced features of the API.
			  * Either all of the advanced features could be guarded by a single sub-permission, such as "themes.advanced", or we could be more specific and have each advanced feature require a sub-permission, such as "themes.tabs", "themes.buttons", "themes.menus", and so forth.
		* have a built-in tool within Firefox to create themes
		* have a tool that will convert lightweight themes to this new API, similar tools for themes from Chromium to use this API
			* could be an "Import" button within the built-in tool
				* might be able to import all the installed themes from a locally installed Chromium same way that we can import history etc from other browsers
		* library window
			* could inherit generic toolbar styles the same way the findbar inherits styles
			* (not for v1, the hope is that this will move to an in-content view like the preferences did)
	* Benchmarks for new API:
		* Should be able to create a dark theme
		* Should be able to create the developer edition theme
			* requires the tab shape to change, back button to be square, findbar colors changes
				* tab shape you get an option: square or curvy
					* if we allowed custom SVG sides then people could mock up other browser UIs better
						* might be difficult to implement within built-in tools, would need heavy documentation about how to use the feature
				* back button you get an option: square or round
				* findbar color changes can use the toolbar colors already defined
	* Built-in Tool
		* less capabilities than the full API
		* Either:
			* interactive map of sorts where you can click a part fo the Firefox UI and set its properties
				* make a color picker appear or a gradient editor
				* have that effect take shape in a sketchy form on the interactive map
					* or on Firefox itself, but the area might not always be visible
			* from about:customizing, hide the palette and show the options there
				* grid of options:
					* name of theme
					* load images for background (set order, position, size, etc for each)
					* text colors
					* options for tab shape, back button
