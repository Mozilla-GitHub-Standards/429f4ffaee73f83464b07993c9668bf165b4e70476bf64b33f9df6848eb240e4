  * [kev] will provide feedback with Amy on the blog post text he sent over
  * [kev] and [jorgev] are working through the PRD and specifically punting on the AMO bits (kev to share gdoc)
  * [jaws] question about how (WebExtension/ theme API) experiments will be measured as successful
    * [kev] something to be expanded upon - define victory definitions to be measurable preferred
    * [dolske] human factor of evaluating experiments - safety valve for us to add missing, but highly appreciate API additions
    * [kev] brief Andy and ask him to set-up/attend experiments overview
