* [kev] going to work on the blog post with Amy today and should have something ready to post early next week
* [mikedeboer] LWT updating: early ideas on how to keep old pipeline on AMO working with webextensions API - technically possible
* [kev/shell] outline of what needs to be thought about.  developer experience: familiar editing experience and conversion.  Jared, Jorge, Amy, Kev to understand how new tools convert to produce new API 
* [dolske] current idea now is to leave creations, submission, update pipeline the same as much as possible until there is more functionality - less of a matrix for change timing with ESR, Fx versions, etc.
* [jaws] LWT properties in central, next step either chrome settings and also performance implications for toolbar icon support (svg).
* [mattw] framework for API and dynamic themes
* [mike] survey results included (appendix) in eng plan and reviewed by dolske.  LWT extension rather than update.  plowed into Add-on Manager...able to make webextension themes install as themes and hit right theme area and icons.  unit testing required API code moving to toolkit component.  hoping land next week.  then continue with theme epic - land one at a time.
* [john] polling general release for most requested changes.  some parts of theming were in there.  example wysiwyg editor for 2nd quarter.
* [dolske] working on blog post still, about halfway done. will circulate a draft to group by early next week
