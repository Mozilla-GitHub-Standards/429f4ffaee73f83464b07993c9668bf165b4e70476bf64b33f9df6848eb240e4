  * Things left to do after the current bugs get fixed
    * [jaws] button icons
    * button icon colors
      * we don't need to switch to SVG to change the colors
        * this won't work for multi-colored icons because it just changes any non-alpha=0 pixel to be the color of choice
      * we just need to set the following two CSS properties
        * filter: url(chrome://browser/skin/filters.svg#fill);
        * fill: <insert-color-here>;
    * SVG icons patch can be applied to cedar?
    * changing the background / foreground of new tab page
    * changing the background and foreground colors of the Firefox menu panel / and other panels
    * in-browser editor? (incorporating jgruen's work / leaving this at the bottom of the priority list to give john more time)
  * Idea: record a screencast of each demo we finish up and send that to the same channels as the survey was sent out to
